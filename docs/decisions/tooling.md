# Decisions — Tooling

See `docs/DECISIONS.md` for the legend. Newest entries go at the end.

- ✅ **The gate has a budget: 5–10 minutes warm, without losing a check** (user, 2026-09-05).
  What changed to meet it: every step prints its wall time (`step`), so a slow gate names its
  culprit; the tools that never touch `target/` (deny, shear, typos, taplo, committed) run on
  a second thread beside the cargo steps with their output captured and printed whole
  (`quiet_step`), since the cargo steps serialise on the build lock anyway; the two iOS
  triples are one `cargo clippy --target … --target …` invocation (one resolve, both targets
  compiled side by side) without `--all-targets` — tests never run on iOS and their code is
  the host's, so the iOS pass checks libraries and binaries; `rustc-wrapper = "sccache"` in
  `.cargo/config.toml` shares dependency compiles between the main checkout, the parallel
  sessions' worktrees and the triples (workspace crates stay incremental, which sccache passes
  through). Timings in MEASUREMENTS.md "gate wall time". Not done: a separate target dir per
  step to overlap cargo invocations (would double the disk and the cold builds).

- ✅ Rust 1.98.1 pinned; edition 2024; resolver 3; `[workspace.lints]` with clippy
  all/pedantic/nursery/cargo + curated restriction lints; `panic = "unwind"` everywhere
  (`panic = "abort"` turns any ObjC exception crossing objc2 into a process abort).

- ✅ **Dependency refresh is a routine, not an event** (2026-09-12): `cargo upgrade --dry-run
  --incompatible` (cargo-edit) lists what the reqs hold back, `cargo update` moves the rest;
  bump the reqs in `Cargo.toml` and the tool floors in `xtask::setup`, then gate and e2e.
  The one crate that must not follow crates.io is `core-video`: `gpui::SurfaceSource:
  From<CVPixelBuffer>` is typed against the fork's version (0.5.2 while zed stays there), so a
  bump to 0.6 fails `slopty-ui` — it moves when the fork's does (comment beside the req).

- ✅ nextest 0.9.144 · insta 1.48 · proptest 1.11 · cargo-mutants 27.1 · cargo-llvm-cov 0.9 ·
  cargo-deny 0.20.2 · cargo-shear 1.13.4 · cargo-hack 0.6.45 · cargo-semver-checks 0.50 ·
  typos 1.50.1 · taplo 0.10 · prek 0.5.2 · bacon 3.25 · samply 0.13.1 · tracing-tracy 0.12.

- ✅ **Releases from Conventional Commits**: `committed` 1.1.11 lints every message (commit-msg
  hook via prek, and `cargo gate` over the range since the last tag); `git-cliff` 2.14.1 computes
  the next version (`--bumped-version`, pre-1.0 rules: breaking → minor, feat → patch) and writes
  `CHANGELOG.md`; `cargo xtask release` glues them and tags `vX.Y.Z`. Rejected: cocogitto
  (last release 2026-03, overlaps both), release-plz / cargo-release (crates.io-centric; nothing
  here is published).

- ✅ **App icon rendered from one SVG at build time** (2026-09-05). `assets/icon.svg` (dark
  full-bleed square, faint dot grid for the canvas, an accent `❯` and a green cursor block) is
  rasterised by `xtask::icon` with `resvg` 0.48.1 + `tiny-skia` 0.12 (MPL-2.0/BSD, already
  allowed) into `Slopty.icns` (16…512 pt at 1× and 2× via `icns` 0.4.0) for `cargo xtask
  bundle` (`CFBundleIconFile`) and a 1024 px PNG in a generated `Assets.xcassets` for `cargo
  xtask ios` (`ASSETCATALOG_COMPILER_APPICON_NAME`). No `iconutil`/`sips`/design tool; `cargo
  xtask icon [dir]` writes the PNG ladder for a look. Full bleed on purpose: macOS 26 and iOS
  apply their own squircle mask, so baked-in rounded corners would double up. Verified: the
  Dock shows the icon for the debug bundle and the iOS 26.5 simulator home screen shows it
  after `cargo xtask ios sim`.

- ✅ Miri only for pure crates (cannot cross objc2 FFI); cargo-careful + ASan/TSan nightly lane for
  the rest; `leaks --atExit` for framework wrappers (Valgrind does not exist on Apple silicon).

- ✅ No mold/lld on macOS (Apple's ld-prime is competitive; mold's Mach-O port is commercial).

- ✅ objc2 0.6.4 / objc2-* 0.3.2 / block2 0.6.2 / dispatch2 0.3.1, pinned exact, `CFRetained`
  ownership in the type system; one counted `from_raw`/`retain` admission per wrapper crate.
