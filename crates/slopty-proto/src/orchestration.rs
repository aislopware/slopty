//! The verbs that drive workers, for people and for AI agents alike.
//!
//! One vocabulary, three surfaces (`docs/decisions/topology.md`): the server's MCP endpoint,
//! the `slopty` CLI and the `slopty mcp` stdio shim all speak these [`Verb`]s to the server,
//! which answers what it knows (the directory) and forwards the rest down the owning worker's
//! connection. Handles are explicit: a terminal is a [`TermRef`] (worker + session), never an
//! index into some earlier listing, so every call stands on its own.
//!
//! Reads come from the worker's terminal engine, never from raw PTY bytes: the rendered screen,
//! scrollback by absolute line index, and OSC 133 command blocks with their exit codes.
