//! A virtual display sized to one client, so a worker can stream a desktop at the client's own
//! size and scale (a headless Mac mini, an iPad, a 5K client).
//!
//! [`plan()`] turns a client's [`Request`] into the display's fixed [`Descriptor`] and its
//! [`Mode`]; it is pure and compiles everywhere. On macOS, [`VirtualDisplay`] creates the
//! display through CoreGraphics' private `CGVirtualDisplay` classes, found at runtime. Elsewhere,
//! and on a macOS without them, it is [`DisplayError::Unavailable`] and the caller streams a
//! physical display instead. [`available()`] says which, creating nothing.
//!
//! On macOS the owner also serves the main thread ([`park_main`]) and enforces again on every
//! display reconfiguration ([`on_reconfiguration`]).
