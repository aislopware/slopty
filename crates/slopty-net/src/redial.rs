//! When a dropped link is dialled again.
//!
//! The server link and every worker link follow the one rule: a quarter second after a drop,
//! doubling per failure to [`MAX`], and back to the start once a link has held for [`STEADY`].
//! A peer still not back after [`PATIENCE`] is dialled less and less often, doubling to
//! [`CEILING`], so a laptop whose link is dead does not wake its radio every two seconds for
//! good. Every wait is spread ([`SPREAD_PERMILLE`]) so links that dropped together do not dial
//! together: within the first minute only ever earlier than the schedule, so a peer that comes
//! back is still dialled within [`MAX`]. Something that says the path may have changed (a resume, a
//! new network path) starts the schedule again ([`Redial::reset`]).
//! A peer on a different build is the exception: it is asked again after [`WRONG_BUILD`].
