//! A counting global allocator for allocation budgets.
//!
//! A test binary installs it once:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! #[global_allocator]
//! static ALLOC: slopty_testkit::alloc::Counting = slopty_testkit::alloc::Counting;
//! ```
//!
//! and [`measure`] then reports what a closure allocated on the calling thread. The counts are
//! kept per thread, so the harness's own threads and a neighbouring test do not move them, and
//! they do not depend on the machine's load: a budget on them can gate every commit where a
//! wall-time budget could not.
//!
//! Only the calling thread is counted. Work the closure hands to another thread is that
//! thread's; a budget over a path that crosses threads measures each side on its own thread.
//!
//! [`live`] is what the calling thread holds now: the bytes it allocated less those it freed,
//! for what a structure keeps rather than what building it cost. A block freed on another
//! thread than the one that made it moves two threads' counts apart, so it is read over work
//! that stays on one thread.
