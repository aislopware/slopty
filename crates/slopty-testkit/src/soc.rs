//! What the Mac's shared media and graphics blocks did over a span, read without root.
//!
//! `powermetrics` needs root, and a measurement run from a test has none. The counters it reads
//! come from `IOReport` (`libIOReport.dylib`), which any process may subscribe to. Over a span this
//! reads, system-wide:
//!
//! - each hardware encode engine's interrupts (`Interrupt Statistics (by index)`, `ave0 0` and
//!   `ave1 0`): one or more a coded frame, so which engine a session's frames went to;
//! - each engine's DRAM traffic (`AMC Stats`, `VENC0` and `VENC1` reads and writes);
//! - how long the GPU was out of its `OFF` state, and the energy it spent (`GPU Stats`, `GPUPH`;
//!   `Energy Model`, `GPU Energy`).
//!
//! The encode block's own energy (`Energy Model`, `AVE0`) reads 0 mJ over any span on an M1 Max
//! running macOS 27.0, and its power state (`SoC Stats`, `AVEMSR`) is `ACT` all the time, idle
//! or not, so neither is offered. Everything here counts every process on the Mac:
//! read an idle span first and take it off. Off macOS, [`Soc::open`] is `None`.
