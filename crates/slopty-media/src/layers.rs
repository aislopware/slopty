//! Temporal layers: when a stream should have frames nothing refers to, which a receiver may
//! skip.
//!
//! With layers on, the encoder writes every other frame as one no later frame is predicted from
//! (`IsDependedOnByOthers` false). A receiver that cannot repair such a frame skips it and shows
//! the next one, where any other lost frame costs a refresh, a round trip and a still picture
//! (`docs/decisions/video.md`, "Frames nothing refers to are skipped, not refreshed").
//!
//! The bits are `slopty_proto::media::flags::DISCARDABLE` and `PREV_DISCARDABLE`.

/// Whether a stream's encoder should write temporal layers now.
///
/// What layers buy exists only on a link that loses: 60 % of the refreshes and 13–51 % of the
/// still picture under clumped loss (MEASUREMENTS.md, "temporal layers under clumped loss").
/// What they cost, switched on a session that has run a while as the worker switches them, is
/// small: -9 % to +11 % of the bytes where the rate has room, and where it binds 0 to 0.6 dB of
/// luma on HEVC and 1.3–1.7 dB on H.264, with no frame dropped (MEASUREMENTS.md, "temporal
/// layers switched on a live session"). The encoder's spend is no guide to that: a layered session
/// spends under a binding target, so spend reads as room exactly while layers are on. So the gate
/// follows the link, with hysteresis, and one signal the layers themselves do not produce: no
/// layered phase measured dropped a frame, even where the rate bound, while a fraction the encoder
/// cannot code drops every one. A layered session that drops frames is in trouble, and layers go
/// off for [`LayerGate::HOLD_WINDOWS`].
///
/// Opening a session with layers, or switching them on within its first frames, is a different
/// encoder: 18–22 % more bytes, 2–6 dB less luma and dropped frames where the rate binds, and
/// switched on after the keyframe alone, 8–17 dB less. The worker switches them on only once a
/// session has coded `LAYERS_AFTER_FRAMES`; this gate never sees a session.
