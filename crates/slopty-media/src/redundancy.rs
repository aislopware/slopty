//! Host side: turn receiver reports into a parity ratio.
//!
//! Reed–Solomon parity is the only repair that costs no round trip, which is what makes it the
//! right first line on a lossy path: a NACK answered one RTT later is a frame the presenter has
//! already given up on. The ratio has to track the loss, though — parity the link does not need
//! is bitrate the picture does not get.
//!
//! The controller is deliberately asymmetric. Loss arrives in bursts, so it **rises on the first
//! bad report and falls slowly**: `MEASUREMENTS.md` ("Wi-Fi/mesh window stream") shows loss
//! coming in clumps between clean seconds, and a symmetric filter spends every clump under-
//! protected and every gap over-protected. It also refuses to move for small changes
//! ([`Redundancy::STEP`]), because every change re-cuts the frame layout at the packetizer and a
//! ratio that jitters by a fragment per frame buys nothing.
//!
//! Pure: the caller passes the report and how many datagrams went out since the last one.
