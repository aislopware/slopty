//! Adaptive video bitrate, driven by the receiver's reports and the QUIC path.
//!
//! The client asks for a ceiling (`Quality::bitrate_bps`); the worker sends at whatever the path
//! sustains below it. Every [`DECIDE_EVERY`] reports (about half a second at the client's
//! 50 ms cadence) the window is judged by [`judge`], a pure function of the summed reports:
//!
//! * **Stall** — any report in the window said the link stalled (nothing arrived for a stall gap;
//!   packets held, then released together): freeze the target. Loss counted during a stall is the
//!   receiver giving up on frames the link is still holding, and the release fills the present
//!   queue for a moment; neither means the path is short of bandwidth, and sending less does not
//!   clear a Wi-Fi stall. The window is discarded (no cut, no grow, cooldown untouched) and the
//!   queue and hold figures of the next [`SETTLE_REPORTS`] reports are not counted, so the burst
//!   the release produces is not judged either. Loss in those reports still counts: a stall
//!   followed by real loss cuts once.
//! * **Overuse** — the client's present queue ≥ 3 frames or its hold p95 above 60 ms (frames
//!   waiting for their missing tail), more than 2 % of the window's frames lost after parity and
//!   NACK had their turn, or datagram loss above 10 %: cut to 75 % and hold for [`COOLDOWN`]
//!   decisions.
//! * **Clean** — datagram loss ≤ 0.5 %, no frame lost, queue ≤ 1, hold p95 ≤ 25 ms: grow by an
//!   eighth (at least [`STEP_MIN_BPS`]) towards the ceiling.
//! * Otherwise stay.
//!
//! Datagram loss between the clean and the heavy line holds rather than cuts. Parity is sized
//! from that same loss (`Redundancy`) and repairs it without a round trip, so on a path that
//! drops at random (Wi-Fi, a tailnet hop) the loss says nothing about the rate: 3 % of i.i.d.
//! loss cut a stream to the floor and halved its cadence for no frame saved (MEASUREMENTS.md,
//! "capture to the glass"). What congestion does that random loss does not is queue, hold
//! frames, outrun the parity, or drop heavily, and each of those still cuts. This is GCC's
//! hold band between 2 and 10 % with the lower line moved to the loss the viewer sees
//! (`docs/decisions/video.md`, "Repaired loss holds the rate").
//!
//! The policy's value (`wanted`) and the target the encoder gets are two numbers: the target is
//! `wanted` capped at 90 % of the selected QUIC path's `cwnd × 8 / rtt`, in every state
//! including a stall, because datagrams are congestion-controlled and sending past the window
//! only queues datagrams on the worker that go stale before they are sent. The path is sampled
//! with every report and the window keeps the *widest* sample: BBR shrinks the congestion
//! window to four packets for 200 ms every few seconds to re-measure the round trip
//! (`ProbeRTT`), and a cap read in those 200 ms would cut a loopback stream to a few Mbit/s
//! (MEASUREMENTS.md, "start-up on a cold connection"). The cap only shadows
//! `wanted`: a stall that shrinks the window drags the target down for as long as the window
//! is small and the target springs back when it recovers, instead of growing back an eighth
//! at a time. A cut is taken from the target actually sent; a clean window under the cap does
//! not grow `wanted` (nothing was learned about rates above the cap).
//!
//! The target then decides the frame rate as well, through [`Cadence`]: a bitrate is spent on
//! however many frames the encoder is handed, so a collapsed path at 60 fps produces sixty
//! smeared frames a second instead of fifteen readable ones. The ladder is the client's ceiling
//! then 60, 30 and 15, and it moves on bytes per frame rather than on the bitrate itself, so a
//! ceiling of 30 and a ceiling of 120 behave the same way.
