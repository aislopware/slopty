//! A still picture, coded again until the encoder stops gaining on it.
//!
//! A frame of a moving picture is coded at the quality its share of the rate buys. When the
//! picture stops, ScreenCaptureKit sends nothing more, so the last frame stays as it was coded,
//! text soft. Handed the same picture again, the low-latency encoder spends the next frames on
//! what the last one missed: on scrolling text at 8 Mbit/s, 1080p 4:2:0 went from 48.5 to 52.2 dB
//! of luma in eight frames, and 4:4:4 from 35.8 to 41.4 dB (MEASUREMENTS.md, "a still picture
//! refined"). Where the moving picture already had the rate it needed there is nothing to gain,
//! and the encoder's own error says so within a frame or two.
//!
//! [`Refine`] is that loop's policy. After a fresh picture goes still, one more frame of it at a
//! time while the encoder's error keeps falling, within a byte budget, spaced so the encoder
//! stays mostly idle for the next real change, and none once a new picture arrives. Only a fresh
//! capture starts a picture over: a keyframe or a refresh answered while the picture is still is
//! a frame of the same picture, and its error joins the record without resetting the count, so
//! refreshes cannot keep the loop alive.
