//! Client side: put fragments back together, recover, deliver in decode order, and decide when
//! to NACK and when to give up and ask for a refresh.
//!
//! State machine per stream:
//!
//! * **Need keyframe** (start): only an IDR starts delivery.
//! * **Need frame *n***: frames leave in order. A frame with missing fragments gets a NACK after a
//!   short silence, retried at most [`Config::nack_retries`] times, and declared lost after the
//!   deadline those retries imply — but only while the link is *flowing*: a retry needs something
//!   to have arrived since the last NACK, and the deadline only counts when newer datagrams are
//!   still coming in. A path that stalls outright (Wi-Fi delay bursts of 100–300 ms hold every
//!   packet and then release them all) is waited out up to [`Config::max_hold`], because a refresh
//!   could not get through it either and everything usually arrives once it clears. When it clears,
//!   every pending frame's NACK clock restarts: the NACK sent into the stall only left with the
//!   release, so its answer is a round trip away from *now*, not from when it was written.
//! * **Need refresh** (after a loss): the worker is asked for a refresh from the last good frame;
//!   the next IDR or LTR-refresh frame restarts delivery and everything older is dropped.
//!
//! Frames whose fragments all arrive are delivered without any parity work; parity is only
//! decoded when data fragments are missing and enough parity arrived.
