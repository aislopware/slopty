//! A ⌘ or ⌃ chord by its character, not its position.
//!
//! Keys go by position, which the worker's layout reads as the client's only once the worker is
//! under the client's input source. A shortcut is meant by its character, though: ⌘Z on a German
//! client's keyboard is Z's key there, Y's position on a US one. So while the worker is not
//! under the client's source, the client names a chord's character
//! ([`slopty_proto::screen::ScreenInput::Key::chord`]), and the worker presses the key that
//! types it under its own layout ([`ChordTable`]), else the position the client sent
//! (`docs/decisions/input.md`, "A shortcut goes by its character").
//!
//! The table is built once per layout, where the platform's layout data may be read, and shared
//! by every stream ([`KeyLayout`]); a press then costs a read lock and a hash lookup, with no
//! allocation.
