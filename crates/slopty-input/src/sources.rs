//! The worker's keyboard input source, matched to the client whose tile has the keyboard.
//!
//! A key goes by its position, and the worker's layout makes the character, so the worker
//! types what the client means only under the client's input source. A stream asks for it
//! when its tile takes the keyboard (`ScreenInput::KeyboardSource`); the worker selects it
//! and answers whether it did. Several clients may ask: the last to ask wins, as the person
//! typing last is the one looking. When a claim goes (the tile idle, the stream ended), the
//! source of the latest claim still held comes back, and once none holds, the one the worker
//! had before the first, with every source the worker turned on for a claim turned off again
//! (`docs/decisions/input.md`, "Keys go by position"). A source the person at the worker picked
//! by hand is theirs: nothing is selected over it, and it is never turned off.
//!
//! [`Claims`] is the pure bookkeeping, keyed by [`Claimant`], a token each stream draws once:
//! stream ids are numbered per connection, and a client that reconnects numbers its streams
//! from one again, so no id a client names can tell two streams apart. [`Sources`] runs it where
//! Text Input Sources Services may be called ([`Tis`], the main queue on macOS), in the order
//! the streams asked, and publishes the source the worker is under as the platform reports each
//! switch ([`Sources::heard`]): a stream whose source was taken by another hears it there and
//! tells its client, and an answer waits for its own switch to be heard rather than a guessed
//! delay. While any claim holds, the worker's own source is kept on disk
//! ([`Sources::keep_at`]), so a run that ends without letting go brings it back at the next
//! start.
