//! `CGEventKeyboardSetUnicodeString` takes at most 20 UTF-16 units per event: Chrome Remote

//! in pieces of at most [`MOST_UNITS`], cut only between composed character sequences (what
//! CoreFoundation says a person sees as one character: a base letter and its marks, a
//! surrogate pair, an emoji with its joiners), never inside one, since a mark or half a pair
