//! The encode engines every stream of this worker shares, and a focused stream's claim on them.
//!
//! Each stream codes on its own VideoToolbox session, and the sessions share the Mac's hardware
//! encode engines: two on an M1 Max, where six 1080p streams at 60 fill both. Past that each
//! stream's encoder watch sees its frames come back late or its captures replaced, and steps its
//! own rung down ([`slopty_media::EncoderWatch`]), so every stream ends up at about 44
//! frames a second, the one the person is working in with the rest (MEASUREMENTS.md, "several
//! streams on the encode engines").
//!
//! A client says which of its streams has its keyboard
//! ([`slopty_proto::screen::ScreenRequest::Focused`]). When a focused stream's watch would step
//! its rung down, the streams nobody focuses step theirs down instead ([`Engines::contended`])
//! and hold there for [`GIVE_WAY_US`]. The watch windows that follow still hold frames queued
//! before the others gave way, so the next give-way waits [`SETTLE_US`] (and two of the focused
//! stream's own windows, which the stream counts). Only when none of them has a rung left does
//! the focused stream pay itself. The hold ends early when no stream is focused any more.
//!
//! Holding the others' captures back while a focused capture goes into its encoder was tried and
//! dropped. An engine codes its sessions' frames in the order they arrive, but over three rounds
//! each way the hold changed the focused stream's p95 by less than the rounds differed from
//! each other. It also cost the other streams 1–3 ms a frame and a rung (MEASUREMENTS.md, "the
//! focused stream when the engines are full").
