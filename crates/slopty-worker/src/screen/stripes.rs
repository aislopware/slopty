//! Whether a stream is coded as two stripes on the two encode engines, or as one picture.
//!
//! Stripes halve the encode of a picture larger than one engine's pixel rate, and cost a scroll
//! twice the bits: scrolled text enters every coded region at its bottom edge, and two stripes
//! have two such edges (`docs/decisions/video.md`, "Two stripes halve the encode at 3K and
//! above"). So a stream is striped only while all of these hold:
//!
//! - this Mac's engines code the two stripes side by side at the stream's size, and the whole
//!   picture takes over [`WHOLE_OVER`] to code (timed once per size and process, [`pays`], and
//!   never under [`TIMED_FROM`] pixels);
//! - the encoder spends well under half its target, so twice a scroll still fits: stripes go on
//!   under [`ON_UNDER`] of it and off over [`OFF_OVER`], each after [`HOLD`] of it.
//!
//! Switching rebuilds the sessions (keyframes), so the gate holds for seconds, not report
//! windows. `SLOPTY_STRIPES=on|off` overrides it: the measurements' and the tests' knob.
