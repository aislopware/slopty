//! When a decoded frame reaches the screen, and what that cost.
//!
//! The rule is **present on arrival**: a frame goes up on the first paint after it comes out of
//! the decoder, and nothing is ever queued for a later one. A queue would buy smoother spacing at
//! the price of a whole frame of latency on every frame, which is the wrong trade for a remote
//! desktop — the source is a screen, not a film, and a late picture is worse than an unevenly
//! spaced one. So the only decision left is what to do when the decoder is ahead of the display:
//! [`Pacer::offer`] replaces the frame waiting to be painted rather than lining up behind it, and
//! counts the one it dropped.
//!
//! The [`Pacer`] is also the instrument. It keeps a ring of the last [`RING`] presented frames and
//! reports, over that window, how long each took from the arrival of the datagram that completed
//! it to the display showing it ([`Pacer::shown`], from the window's presentation report, a
//! refresh or more after the paint), how far apart those were, and how often a paint showed the
//! same picture again ([`PacingStats::repeats`]) or the display never saw one at all
//! ([`PacingStats::skipped`]). Those two counters are the double-present / skipped-present
//! pattern; on a steady source matched to the display both stay near zero.
//!
//! Where the worker's clock is this process's too (loopback: the host time clock the worker stamps
//! captures with and [`Instant`] both read mach absolute time), a [`ClockAnchor`] given to
//! [`Pacer::share_clock`] lets the ring time each frame from its capture as well, and inputs the
//! caller marks with [`Pacer::input_sent`] and [`Pacer::input_visible`] are timed from their send
//! to the first frame shown that has them ([`Pacer::glass`]).
//!
//! Everything here is pure: the caller supplies the clock ([`Clock`]), so the policy is testable
//! without a window.
