//! The audio ring under loom: the decoder's thread and the device's render callback over every
//! interleaving of their atomics, a load free to read any of the stores loom keeps (the last
//! seven of each atomic), which is where a missing release or acquire shows. `cargo xtask deep
//! loom` runs it with `--cfg slopty_loom`, where `RING_SAMPLES` is four frames and
//! `FADE_FRAMES` one (`docs/decisions/tooling.md`, "The audio ring is model-checked with loom").
//!
//! Each published sample is [`VALUE`] plus its position, so what the device plays says where it
//! came from. Whatever the order, the device
//! - plays a run's samples once each, in order from the run's front, with nothing skipped;
//! - never plays a sample before the start's fade-in was written to it (a click);
//! - plays nothing of a muted run after anything of the next one;
//! - fills the rest of a render with the ramp from the last frame it played, then silence.
