//! The shaping half of `slopty-shape`: when a packet may leave, and whether it leaves at all.
//!
//! Slopty's congestion rulings — the cadence ladder's rungs, whether a keyframe waits for its
//! own headroom, how much audio to hold before playing — all describe what happens on a link
//! that has collapsed. Measuring them needs a link that collapses on demand, and the kernel's
//! own shapers (`dnctl`, `pfctl`) want a password this process does not have. So the impairment
//! goes in a relay the two ends speak through, below QUIC, where the congestion controller sees
//! it as the network and reacts the way it would to a real bottleneck.
//!
//! Time here is elapsed time since the run began, not a clock: the arithmetic stays total, and a
//! test can name an instant as a number of milliseconds. Every draw comes from a seed, so a run
//! repeats exactly — a measurement that cannot be repeated cannot be compared.
